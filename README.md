# Hot2Mol


This is a repository of our paper "Target-specific design of drug-like PPI inhibitors via hot-spot-guided generative deep learning". 

Proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPIs) are vital therapeutic targets. However, the large and flat PPI interfaces pose challenges for the development of small-molecule inhibitors. Traditional computer-aided drug design approaches typically rely on pre-existing libraries or expert knowledge, limiting the exploration of novel chemical spaces needed for effective PPI inhibition. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Hot2Mol, a deep learning framework for the de novo design of drug-like, target-specific PPI inhibitors. Hot2Mol generates small molecules by mimicking the pharmacophoric features of hot-spot residues, enabling precise targeting of PPI interfaces without the need for bioactive ligands.

### Creating a new environment in conda
Installation typically takes within 5 minutes.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate Hot2Mol
```

## Training

Unzip the `data.zip` folder to get the training and validation data.

Run `train.py` using the following command:
```bash
python train.py <output_dir> --device cuda:0 --show_progressbar
```



## Use a pre-trained Hot2Mol model to generate molecules

### Prepare model weights

Download the model files from the [release page](https://github.com/sun-heqi/Hot2Mol/releases/tag/v1.0).
Save to `Hot2Mol/pretrained_model` folder


### Prepare pharmacophore hypotheses

Hot2Mol requires a pharmacophore hypothesis of "hot-spot" residues as input. Construct the hypothesis by sampling pharmacophores from the top-3 hot-spot residues identified using docking methods like [HawkDock](http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/hawkdock/), which computes residue-wise binding energy with MM/GBSA. Hot-spot residues can also be obtained from relevant literature.

A pharmacophore hypothesis should be provided in `.posp` format, which includes the type of pharmacophore feature in the first column and spatial coordinates in the last three columns. See `data/1z92_IL2R.posp` for an example.

**Supported pharmacophore types**:
- AROM: aromatic ring
- POSC: cation
- HACC: hydrogen bond acceptor
- HDON: hydrogen bond donor
- HYBL: hydrophobic group (ring)
- LHYBL: hydrophobic group (non-ring)


### Build the hypotheses

Use the `pharma_extract.py` to generate a pharmacophore hypothesis for hot-spot residues. 

usage:
```text
python pharma_extract.py [-h] pdb_file residues output_file

positional arguments:
  pdb_file            Path to the PDB file of the PPI chain that includes the selected hot-spot residues.
  residues            List of residues in the format RESIDUE_NAME RESIDUE_NUMBER (e.g., LYS 7)
  output_file         Path to the output .posp file.
```

The output is a `.posp` file containing the pharmacophore hypotesis. 


To build pharmacophore hypothesis for the demo input:
```bash
python pharma_extract.py data/1z92_IL2R.pdb ARG 36 LEU 42 HIE 120 data/1z92_IL2R.posp
```

### Generate

Use `generate.py` to generate molecules.

usage:
```text
python generate.py [-h] [--n_mol N_MOL] [--device DEVICE] [--filter] [--batch_size BATCH_SIZE] [--seed SEED] input_path output_dir model_path tokenizer_path

positional arguments:
  input_path            the input file path. If it is a directory, then every file ends with `.posp` will be processed
  output_dir            the output directory
  model_path            the weights file (xxx.pth)
  tokenizer_path        the saved tokenizers (tokenizer_r_iso.pkl, tokenizer_delta_qeppi.pkl)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --n_mol N_MOL         number of generated molecules for each pharmacophore file
  --device DEVICE       `cpu` or `cuda`, default:'cpu'
  --filter              whether to save only the unique valid molecules
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
  --seed SEED
```

The output is a `.txt` file containing the generated SMILES strings. Using a single 3090Ti, it takes approximately 30 seconds to generate 10,000 molecules.


To run generation on the demo input:
```bash
python generate.py data/1z92_IL2R.posp results pretrained_model/epoch32.pth pretrained_model --n_mol 1000 --filter --device cuda:0 --seed 123
```


The current model allows for a maximum of 8 pharmacophore features in a single hypothesis. To increase this limit, you can retrain the model with a greater number of randomly selected pharmacophore elements and a larger `MAX_NUM_PP_GRAPHS`.
